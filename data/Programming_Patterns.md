### Programming patterns:

This document outlines the preferred programming patterns for this repo. Any developers or LLMs working on this project should refactor code to adhere to these patterns:

- All files that export react components should be named in `PascalCase` - the only exceptions are files generated by Shadcn, or file-based conventions including Next.js routing files (`page.tsx` etc)
- database interactions should use a useQuery or useMutation hook from react-query tanstack (see related documentation). The hook should then call an action. Hooks are stored in `[table name]Hooks.tsx` format, actions are `[table name]Hooks.ts`. Hook files include 'use client' and action files include 'use server' at the top.
- Directory structure and file naming:
  - Types: `types/[name].types.ts`
  - Actions: `actions/[name].actions.ts`
  - Hooks: `hooks/[name].hooks.ts`
  - Utils: `lib/[name].util.ts`
  - providers: `providers/[name].provider.ts`
- Types shouldn't be exported from a file they are used in.
